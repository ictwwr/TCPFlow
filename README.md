# TCPFlow
INTRODUCTION TO TCPFLOW
======================
TCPFlow is a software tool that analyzes offline and online packet traffic for the statistics of 5-tuple TCP flows. It has two versions written with C in Linux: TCPFlow-Offline and TCPFlow-Online.<br>

1.TCPFlow-Offline
-------------------
TCPFlow-Offline processes a traffic file in pcap format generated by WireShark and TCPDump. It outputs the statistics of TCP flows to a text file in the following format:<br>
<local_time>, <time_stamp>, <src_ip>, <src_port>, <dst_ip>, <dst_port>, <tcp/udp><br>
In addition, it also outputs the ranking statistics of TCP flows including the Top 10 TCP flows in packets and in bytes, Top 10 source IP addresses, and Top 10 destination IP addresses.<br>
TCPFlow_Offline runs with the following parameters:<br>
tcpflow-offline [-r <input_pcap_file>] [-w <output_flow_file>] [-s <output_stat_file>]<br>

2.TCPFlow-Online
--------------
TCPFlow-Online captures online packet TCP flows with a promiscuous mode in a network device. It outputs 5-tuples of each TCP flow to a text file in the following format:<br>
<local_time>, <time_stamp>, <src_ip>, <src_port>, <dst_ip>, <dst_port>, <tcp/udp><br>
TCPFlow-Online runs with the following parameters:<br>
tcpflow-online [-i <netdevice_num>] [-c <packet_count>][-w <output_flow_file>] [-s <output_stat_file>]<br>

PREPARATION
===========
To run TCPFlow, please make sure of installing the libpcap libraries with the root permission.<br>

HOW TO USE IT
=============
You can compile and run TCPFlow in Linux as follows:<br>

1.TCPFlow-Offline
-------------
(1)Compile TCPFlow-Offline:<br>
gcc -o tcpflow-offline tcpflow_offline.c<br>
(2)Run TCPFlow-Offline<br>
./tcpflow-offline -r test.pcap -w output_tcpflow.txt -s output_summary.txt<br>

2.TCPFlow-Online
---------------
(1)Compile TCPFlow-Online:<br>
gcc -o tcpflow_online tcpflow_online.c -lpcap <br>
(2)Run TCPFlow-Online<br>
./tcpflow_online -i eth0 -c 2000 -w output_tcpflow.txt -s output_summary.txt
